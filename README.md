# Hyss - High Impact Style Sheets

## Rationale

Define styles as python dicts! All of the power of python, realised to create stylesheets.

## TODO

- Create a function to build a dict from a stylesheet

- Generate helpers for features such as keyframe animations, nested class rules etc.

- Create a means of generating individual styles to be scoped to specific element tags, akin to
how style sheets function in many css-in-js libraries
